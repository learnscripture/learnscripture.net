### Memory model ###

# We try to fit the progress of a memory to a idealised exponential curve:
#
# s = 1 - exp(-alpha Ã— t^exponent)

# A strength of 1 is perfect, but we assume that a person never reaches this.
# We attempt to move a memory along this curve by testing at ever increasing
# intervals. This idea is taken from the Charlotte Mason Scripture Memory system.

# We fix alpha and exponent by trial and error to
# give us:

# 1) the right initial testing sequence (lots of times initially,
#    preferably about a week where they are tested every day.
# 2) a tail that remains for over a year, so it doesn't
#    drop the memory too quickly.


EXPONENT = 0.2
ALPHA = 5e-2


def s(t):
    return 1 - math.exp(-ALPHA * t**EXPONENT)

# where 's' is the strength of the memory and t is the time elapsed,
# and alpha is a constant. We will also need the inverse:

def t(s):
    return (- math.log(1 - s) / ALPHA)**(1.0/EXPONENT)

# These increasing intervals on the time axis can correspond to even size
# intervals on the strength axis since we have an exponential as above.
#
# When a memory is tested, the score is evidence of the current strength of the
# memory. However, the new recorded strength is not simply set to the test
# score. If someone has recently been prompted, the information may simply be in
# short term memory, and we are only interested in long term memory.  So we use
# the test information to adjust the current recorded strength, not replace it.
# A user is not allowed to beat the above curve.
#
# The idealised curve above represents the behaviour if the user scores 100% on
# all tests. In this way, the memory will never stop being a candidate for
# testing, even if the user aces the tests.
#
# At every point, we assume that the memory is following the curve above, so for
# calculating intervals in 't', we don't look at the actual 't' since they first
# began. Instead we only look at time intervals between the current time and the
# last test. This keeps us robust against the case where they started learning
# and then had a long gap, or forgot it completely.
#
# If the user does much worse than 100%, all that happens is that they progress
# along the 't' curve much more slowly than the model suggests, and they will
# be tested more frequently as a result, which is the behaviour we want.
#
# For every memory, we attempt to test it after an ideal interval delta_t_ideal
#
# delta_t_ideal corresponds to an interval delta_s_ideal from the current
# strength.  We aim to fit delta_s_ideal to a constant that will produce a fixed
# number of tests to move the memory from strength zero to 'one'. In the
# Charlotte Mason system, a verse is tested about 15 - 20 times, so we aim for
# 20 tests in 2 years.

# For the initial test, we don't have a previous strength recorded. We
# arbitrarily set the initial strength to be 0.1 test strength

INITIAL_STRENGTH_FACTOR = 0.1

# Trial and error - this gives us approx 20 tests in 2 years,
# and doesn't get us too close to strength=1 after 100 years.
DELTA_S_IDEAL = 0.02


# If we have a strength of 1 it will stop the memory from ever being tested, and
# break our maths below.
BEST_STRENGTH = 0.999999999999999

# Given an old strength, a new test score, and the number of seconds elapsed,
# we need to calculate the new strength estimate.

def strength_estimate(old_strength, test_strength, time_elapsed):
    if old_strength is None or time_elapsed is None:
        return INITIAL_STRENGTH_FACTOR * test_strength

    # If they have gone down from recorded strength, that is very strong
    # evidence of their new test_strength, so we simply return that value.
    if test_strength < old_strength:
        return test_strength

    if old_strength == 1.0:
        return BEST_STRENGTH


    # Otherwise, we do not allow the strength to increase more than
    # our formula allows. Another way of interpreting the following
    # calculation is that a test after a long gap is better evidence
    # of it having gone into memory than a test after a short gap.

    s1 = old_strength
    delta_t = time_elapsed

    # We assume old strength was accoding to our formula
    t1 = t(s1)

    t2 = t1 + time_elapsed

    # If they got 100% in test, we would have this value of s:
    s2 = s(t2)

    # Giving:
    delta_s_max = s2 - s1

    # However, we have to adjust for the fact that test_strength may be < 1
    #
    # Long term, if test_strength hits a ceiling, then s should tend to
    # test_strength, and not to 1. This implies:
    #
    #   delta_s_actual == 0 for test_strength == old_strength
    #
    # We also need to fit:
    #
    #   delta_s_actual == 1 for test_strength == 1.

    delta_s_actual = delta_s_max * (test_strength - old_strength) / (1.0 - old_strength)
    new_strength = old_strength + delta_s_actual
