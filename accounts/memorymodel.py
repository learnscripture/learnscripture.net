    ### Memory model ###

    # We try to fit the progress of a memory to a idealised exponential curve:
    #
    # s = 1 - exp(-alpha Ã— t^exponent)

    # A strength of 1 is perfect, but we assume that a person never reaches this.
    # We attempt to move a memory along this curve by testing at ever increasing
    # intervals. This idea is taken from the Charlotte Mason Scripture Memory system.

    # We fix alpha and exponent by trial and error to give us:

    # 1) the right initial testing sequence (lots of times initially, preferably
    #    about a week where they are tested every day.
    # 2) a tail that remains for over a year, so it doesn't drop the memory too
    #    quickly.

    # We need s:

    def s(self, t):
        return 1 - math.exp(-self.ALPHA * t**self.EXPONENT)

    # where 's' is the strength of the memory and t is the time elapsed,
    # We will also need the inverse:

    def t(self, s):
        return (- math.log(1 - s) / self.ALPHA)**(1.0/self.EXPONENT)

    # These increasing intervals on the time axis can correspond to even size
    # intervals on the strength axis since we have an exponential as above.
    #
    # When a memory is tested, the score is evidence of the current strength of the
    # memory. However, the new recorded strength is not simply set to the test
    # score. If someone has recently been prompted, the information may simply be in
    # short term memory, and we are only interested in long term memory.  So we use
    # the test information to adjust the current recorded strength, not replace it.
    # A user is not allowed to beat the above curve.
    #
    # The idealised curve above represents the behaviour if the user scores 100% on
    # all tests. In this way, the memory will never stop being a candidate for
    # testing, even if the user aces the tests.
    #
    # At every point, we assume that the memory is following the curve above, so for
    # calculating intervals in 't', we don't look at the actual 't' since they first
    # began. Instead we only look at time intervals between the current time and the
    # last test. This keeps us robust against the case where they started learning
    # and then had a long gap, or forgot it completely.
    #
    # If the user does much worse than 100%, all that happens is that they progress
    # along the 't' curve much more slowly than the model suggests, and they will
    # be tested more frequently as a result, which is the behaviour we want.
    #
    # For every memory, we attempt to test it after an ideal interval delta_t_ideal
    #
    # delta_t_ideal corresponds to an interval delta_s_ideal from the current
    # strength.  We aim to fit delta_s_ideal to a constant that will produce a fixed
    # number of tests to move the memory from strength zero to 'one'. In the
    # Charlotte Mason system, a verse is tested about 15 - 20 times before being
    # retired, so we aim for that (with a bit of tuning)

    VERSE_TESTS = 18

    # We want to avoid the number of verses needing testing increasing forever,
    # and so put a hard limit, after which a verse is considered 'learnt'.

    LEARNT = 0.9

    # A person's score for a verse will never exceed what they consistently
    # score for that verse. So this means that if a person is scoring 90% or
    # less for a verse, it will never be considered learnt. 90% is quite
    # achievable with our testing method (100% is common), so this is a
    # sensible figure.


    # We want to reach this stage after 1 year on our idealised curve.

    # This will mean that if we learn X new verses every day,
    # there will be X*VERSE_TESTS verses to revise each day.

    # Some maths below needs a limit to stop us getting logs of
    # negative numbers:
    BEST_STRENGTH = 0.999


    # We allow one of these parameters to be tuned - pick EXPONENT
    def __init__(self, EXPONENT):

        # The other can be set using the above constants:

        # s  = 1 - exp(-alpha * t^n)
        # LEARNT = 1 - exp(-alpha * ONE_YEAR^n)
        # Rearranging:

    # Given an old strength, a new test score, and the number of seconds elapsed,
    # we need to calculate the new strength estimate.

    # For the initial test, we don't have a previous strength recorded. We
    # arbitrarily set the initial strength to be 0.1 test strength

    INITIAL_STRENGTH_FACTOR = 0.1  # This is also used in learn.js

            return test_strength

        if old_strength == 1.0:
            return self.BEST_STRENGTH


        # Otherwise, we do not allow the strength to increase more than
        # our formula allows. Another way of interpreting the following
        # calculation is that a test after a long gap is better evidence
        # of it having gone into memory than a test after a short gap.

        s1 = old_strength
        delta_t = time_elapsed

        # We assume old strength was according to our formula
        t1 = self.t(s1)

        t2 = t1 + time_elapsed

        # If they got 100% in test, we would have this value of s:
        s2 = self.s(t2)

        # Giving:
        delta_s_max = s2 - s1

        # However, we have to adjust for the fact that test_strength may be < 1
        #
        # Long term, if test_strength hits a ceiling, then s should tend to
        # test_strength, and not to 1. This implies:
        #
        #   delta_s_actual == 0 for test_strength == old_strength
        #
        # We also need to fit:
        #
        #   delta_s_actual == 1 for test_strength == 1.
