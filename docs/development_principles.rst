 Development principles
========================

The usual things for developing a Django app apply. Test driven development is
very helpful for many things - see project_structure.rst for more.

Additionally, more specifically to LearnScripture.net:

* For a large number of users mobile devices are their primary device. The site
  should have a first class experience on small screens and touch screens.

* A significant number of users are children. We've aimed to make the interface
  simple enough for even quite young children to use.

* We've aimed to add motivational features that promote long-term Bible
  memorisation habits.
