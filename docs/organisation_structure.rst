 Organisation structure
========================

LearnScripture.net is currently a very small organisation. It was originally run
as a small business in the UK, but that business has now been stopped and the
bank account closed.

The terms of the `API <http://www.esvapi.org/>`_ we use for the ESV text
prohibit commercial use. For that reason and others, LearnScripture.net has to
be run entirely on a non-profit basis, and must be free to use.

Generating revenue from ads is also very difficult:

* ads of any kind will hurt the user experience seriously. This is especially true
  as the two pages that are typically used a lot (dashboard and learning page)
  need all the available space for user interface.

* ad networks are increasingly hostile, often attempting to attack users with malware.

LearnScripture.net is therefore funded entirely by donations. As and when needed
(usually around Easter each year) a donation drive is set up on the site:

This is usually sufficient to cover the modest financial needs, which are:

* Hosting costs, currently $6/month on DigitalOcean
* Domain name costs, currently about 29 GBP for 2 years.
