<p>If you like LearnScripture.net and want to spread the word about it, our
referral program will help you get <strong>discounts</strong> on the
subscription fees.</p>

<h2>What you get</h2>

<p>If you get <b>one person</b> to sign up to LearnScripture.net and become a
paid member, you get a <b>10%</b> discount on your subscription fees.</p>

<p>If you get <b>three people</b> to sign up to LearnScripture.net and become
paid members, you get a <b>20%</b> discount on your subscription fees.</p>

<p>The discount will apply if the referrals have become paying members when you
next have to pay your subscription fees, and the discount will remain <b>every
time after that</b> if the referrals are still paying members.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

{% if referral_link %}

<p>For us to recognise that you were the source of the referral, you <b>must</b>
use the following link to refer people to LearnScripture.net:</p>

<p class="referral-link">{{ referral_link }}</p>

<p>Copy-and-paste this link and pass it on to a friend, and if they use it to
get to the site, and then start learning verses, we'll track it and know that
you referred them.</p>

{% else %}

<p>You first need an account, and need to <a href="#" class="login-link">sign in</a> to get the full instructions and the referral link.</p>

{% endif %}


<h2>Please don't:</h2>

<ul class="dont">
  <li>Send bulk emails to friends about this. Many of them may consider this to
  be spam, or even think it came from us, and you may give LearnScripture.net a
  bad name!
  </li>
  <li>Nag people to sign up just so that you can get a discount. Remember
  that you won't get a discount unless they actually become <b>paying</b>
  members themselves.
</ul>

<h2>Please do:</h2>

<ul class="do">
  <li>Post this link to social sites like Facebook, Twitter or Pinterest (as long as you don't post it repeatedly and annoy people!)
  <li>Include some personal comment about why you like LearnScripture.net or how it has helped you.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Shortcuts</h2>

<p>Use the following to get started quickly:</p>

<div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style "
     addthis:url="{{ referral_link }}">
<a class="addthis_button_facebook_like" fb:like:layout="button_count"></a>
<a class="addthis_button_tweet"></a>
<a class="addthis_button_google_plusone" g:plusone:size="medium"></a>
<a class="addthis_counter addthis_pill_style"></a>
</div>


<h2>Specific pages</h2>

<p>You can also get a referral link for specific pages. At the bottom of most
pages that make good starting points, you'll see 'share' links, and a 'referral
link' that you should click on to get the link to use (see the bottom of this
page for an example).</p>

<p>This can be especially useful to get a group of friends all learning
a <a href="{% url 'choose' %}">verse set</a>.</p>
