      <h3>Easy to use</h3>
      <p>We try to make sure that your effort is spent memorizing the Bible, and
        not figuring out what to do next or trying to track your progress.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Online</h3>

      <p>No need to install anything, it works with any <a href="/browsers/">recent browser</a>, and no
        problems if something happens to your computer.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Proven system</h3>
      <p>Based on principles from the Charlotte Mason Scripture Memory System and
        other proven techniques for memory strengthening, we’ve added some 21st
        century refinements to produce an extremely efficient method.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Great for phones</h3>

      <p>The interface has been designed to adapt to small screens,
        so you can use the same web site from your desktop, laptop or other internet capable
        device, including <a href="/handhelds/">most recent smart-phones</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Child friendly</h3>
      <p>With a choice of fun interface themes and a memorisation method which
        works well with all ages, we’ve made sure that children will have no problem
        using the site. (Parents have to create accounts though).</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Social</h3>
      <p>Our groups, leaderboards, comments, points and
        <a href="{% url 'awards' %}">badges</a> features are
        great for keeping things fun, addictive and motivational!</p>

      <p>You can also add and share your own sets of verses to learn — perfect for
        <a href="{% url 'groups' %}">church or friendship groups</a> who want to learn the same thing.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Free!</h3>
